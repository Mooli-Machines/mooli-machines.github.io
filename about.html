    <p>The mooli, which you might know as the daikon, is a humble radish which is often used as a cover crop.</p>
    <p>Once planted, it works quitely and diligently, breaking up rough soil, preventing weeds from taking root, and delivering and maintaining nutrients.</p>
    <p>It also happens to be tasty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mooli Machines wishes to be a radish for your business. Working with Mooli means prepping the fields for whatever you want to grow down the line.</p>
    <p>We love to work with small-to-medium-sized businesses or teams within larger businesses to tackle problems with data, integration, and automation.</p>
    <p>We work with your existing technology and processes and slowly break up that rough soil, growing with you and making small changes to prevent weeds from taking root.</p>
    <p>In time, the soil will be rich and nutritious, and you will be ready to farm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our long term goal is to produce public goods in the form of research and tools which will help bring automation to the masses.</p>
    <p>We take a broad view of automation, which means as much as we love cutting-edge frontier tech, we do not shy away from business process automation tasks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our first tool is [REDACTED], which will hopefully help tackle a few problems in the [REDACTED] industry.</p>
